    "      \"UI Code Generation Rules:\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- You MUST generate valid React + TypeScript + Next.js App Router code only.\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Prefer modern UI component libraries over raw HTML/Bootstrap.\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- You may use shadcn/ui, Mantine, NextUI, Flowbite-React, DaisyUI, or HeadlessUI.\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Pick one library per component group for simplicity/readability; do not mix them all at once.\\n\\n\"\n",
    "      \"Responsiveness & UX:\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Mobile nav must not overflow: on small screens use a compact 4-5 icon nav (or bottom bar) and move search into a sheet/dialog.\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Add loading skeletons for feed cards, suggestions, and sidebar instead of blank states.\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Make sidebar/feed sections independently scrollable when tall.\\n\\n\"\n",
    "      \"Production-ready output only. Every button must have a real purpose/link; avoid self-links or '#'. Route to real pages (use known page names from the layouts) or meaningful in-page anchors; if it triggers behavior, wire a plausible action with synthetic data and Recoil state where appropriate.\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Post/CTA buttons must actually update UI state (e.g., append a post or open a form) rather than no-ops.\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- If prior page code is provided, reuse structure/styles and augment rather than replacing.\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Also return a non-empty 'context' string summarizing the page purpose, key CTAs/links, and any reusable patterns.\\n\\n\"\n",
    "      \"Hallucination / data rules:\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Do NOT invent external API calls or network requests.\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Do NOT invent real external image URLs from random CDNs or photography sites.\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- For images, use stable placeholder sources (e.g., `https://picsum.photos/seed/landing/800/500`) or clearly local assets (e.g., `/images/hero.png`).\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- If some content or images are ambiguous from the layout JSON, choose generic but realistic placeholders.\\n\\n\"\n",
    "      \"Code output rules:\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Output MUST be a single, default-exported React component suitable for a Next.js App Router file (e.g., `app/<route>/page.tsx`).\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- The code must compile as TypeScript without type errors.\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Include all required imports (React, Next, component library imports, etc.).\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Use named functions or `const ComponentName: React.FC = () => { ... }` with a default export at the end.\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Ensure all JSX tags are properly closed.\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Do NOT include `TODO` placeholders, pseudo-code, or omitted handlers.\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Do NOT wrap the output in markdown or code fences.\\n\\n\"\n",
    "      \"Product/experience consistency:\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Use the layout for the current filename to drive structure.\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- If the structured layout JSON includes multiple pages, keep styling, typography, and navigation consistent with the other pages, but only implement the page that matches the current filename.\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Keep relevant pages connected with navbar links, buttons, and consistent content/contrast, but do not implement other pages’ full layouts here.\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Use empty space wisely by adding relevant sections such as secondary CTAs, feature highlights, testimonials, FAQs, or footers as appropriate, rather than leaving large blank areas.\\n\\n\"\n",
    "      \"Content constraints:\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- There should be no mention of sketches, layout JSON, detection boxes, OCR, or any internal representation.\\n\"\n",
    "      \"- Do NOT mention that this UI was generated or that you are an AI.\\n\"\n",
